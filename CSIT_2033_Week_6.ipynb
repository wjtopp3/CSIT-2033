        "  - Rather than outputting raw strings, logs can include fields like event_type, user_id, timestamp, and operation_status.\n",

        "- Securely deploying machine learning models is critical in environments where privacy, intellectual property, or safety is at stake.\n",
        "- Unlike traditional software, machine learning models can be reverse-engineered or exploited in subtle ways, including model extraction attacks or unauthorized use of prediction APIs.\n",
        "- Deploying an AI model securely means more than serving it efficiently; it requires restricted access, hardened infrastructure, and strict interaction controls.\n",
        "- A decision must also be made of where computation will happen: in the cloud, on-premises, or at the edge‚Äîeach with trade-offs in performance, privacy, and security.\n",
        "- One of the most effective strategies is to restrict access to inference endpoints and model files [8]  \n",
        "- In practice, this means hosting APIs behind a firewall, limiting network access with IP allowlists or VPNs, and storing model artifacts (like .pkl or .pt files) in protected locations with limited read access\n",
        "- For containerized deployments, models can be stored inside secure Docker images with reduced permissions, ensuring that even if a container is compromised, the model cannot be easily exfiltrated.\n",
        "- To prevent abuse, authentication and authorization mechanisms should be applied to every request, including API keys, OAuth tokens, or TLS certificates.\n",
        "- Rate limiting and anomaly detection can help identify and stop brute-force or scraping attempts, while request logging provides an audit trail to monitor access patterns.\n",
        "- Additionally, compiled model representations (e.g., [ONNX](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/latest/architecture/architecture-overview.html#onnx)) makes it harder for attackers to reverse-engineer model internals.\n",
        "  - ONNX, as an open standard, doesn't necessarily add much to the security, but additional actions can be taken such as obfuscating the model, disallowing direct access through APIs, encrypting it at rest, and using secure enclaves (see below).\n",
        "- Protecting models both in memory and at rest is essential to avoid leakage or tampering.\n",
        "- At rest, models should be encrypted using strong AES-based schemes, and stored in secure storage solutions like AWS KMS-integrated S3 buckets or encrypted volumes.\n",
        "- In memory, using secure enclaves (protected regions of memory) (e.g., [Intel SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/software-guard-extensions.html)) can shield inference computations from the rest of the system.\n",
        "- Secure containers (e.g., an [AppArmor-enabled Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/)) and runtime sandboxes (like [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/)) make sure a model operates within an isolated environment with limited system privileges."
