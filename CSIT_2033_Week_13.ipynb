        "- [5] Olmstead Ch. 6\n",
        "- A **threat modeling framework** provides a structured approach to identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential security threats in a system or application. These frameworks help teams anticipate how attackers might exploit vulnerabilities and guide the design of appropriate defenses before issues occur.\n",
        "- Two common frameworks include **STRIDE** and **DREAD**\n",
        "- The STRIDE model is a Microsoft framework for identifying and categorizing different security threats affecting a system.\n",
        "  - Spoofing - an attacker pretending to be someone/something else, e.g., gaining unauthorized access with a valid user's credentials\n",
        "  - Tampering - unauthorized modification of data, code, or system components, e.g., altering database contents, disrupting a system's regular operation\n",
        "  - Repudiation - denying actions or events by a user or system entity making it hard to attribute responsibility, e.g., manipulating a log file to make it appear someone else did something\n",
        "  - Information disclosure - exposing sensitive information to unauthorized individuals or systems, e.g., sharing confidential data, such as student grade or financial information, or personal health information\n",
        "  - Denial of Service (DOS) - disrupt or degrade the availability of a system or its components, making them inaccessible to legitimate users, e.g., flooding a web server with requests so legitimate users can't access information\n",
        "  - Elevation of privilege - an attacker gains a higher level of access or permission than authorized ones, e.g., a vulnerability allows a user to escalate from regular user to administrator\n",
        "- The DREAD model uses a scale from 0 to 10 for each component, with a lower score being better\n",
        "  - Damage - assesses the potential impact of a security vulnerability if it were to be exploited; 0 indicates no damage, 10 indicates catastrophic damage\n",
        "  - Reproducibility - how easily can an attacker reproduce the conditions necessary to exploit a vulnerability; 0 means the vulnerability is difficult to impossible to reproduce, and 10 means it is effortless to reproduce\n",
        "  - Exploitability - how easily an attacker can exploit a vulnerability, considering the complexity of the attack and skills required to carry it out\n",
        "  - Affected users - assessing the number of users or systems that could be impacted if a vulnerability is exploited\n",
        "  - Discoverability - how easy can a vulnerability be discovered by an attacker; 0 means difficult and 10 means straightforward"

        "      - Fixed in 3.9.0\n",
        "    - jupyter-server has multiple high and medium CVEs\n",
        "  - cryptography 43.0.3 has a known LOW severity issue — fixed in 44.0.1\n",
        "- Should You Be Concerned?\n",
        "  - Yes, especially for HIGH severity vulnerabilities in actively used libraries like keras (RCE risk), jupyter-server (user hash disclosure, redirection, etc.), and Mako (REDos).\n",
        "  - These could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems if exposed to malicious input — particularly in multi-user/shared environments like Jupyter notebooks or APIs.\n",
        "- What You Should Do\n",
        "  - Upgrade the packages: use pip install --upgrade <package> or pin higher versions in requirements.txt\n",
        "  - Avoid vulnerable versions when building distributable apps or APIs."
