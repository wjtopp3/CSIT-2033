        "\n",
        "In this activity, you will take on the role of a security reviewer assessing a basic web application before deployment. The goal is to apply your knowledge of secure software design by identifying weaknesses in the system's architecture, assumptions, and implementation. Below you will find design notes, a test plan, and source code for a minimal Flask-based web service called SimpleReg, which performs basic user registration and message display. As a Security Analyst, you will receive regular security design review assignments. This exercise is an example of that job responsibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "While SimpleReg appears functional, it contains intentional security gaps that mirror common real-world oversights. You will conduct a structured Security Design Review, evaluating the application's functionality, data flows, and trust boundaries. This includes reviewing how user data is handled, identifying missing controls, and recommending mitigations using secure design principles. Be prepared to report findings and recommendations.\n",

        "- Can malicious input be used to manipulate the application's behavior?\n",

        "### 4. Error Handling & Logging\n",
        "- Are errors returned in a safe and user-friendly way?\n",

        "- Is logging implemented or planned for future monitoring?\n",

        "- Is the app configured to run with HTTPS in production?\n",

        "### 6. Dependency & Environment Management\n",
        "- Are third-party libraries (e.g., Flask) kept up to date?\n",
        "- Are there plans to manage secrets or configuration securely?\n",

        "### 7. Review of Design Notes and Test Plan\n",

        "- Are there any missing test cases that would improve coverage (e.g., long input, malformed JSON)?\n",

        "- Extra/Unexpected fields: Include extra keys like \"role\": \"admin\" and confirm they are ignored.\n",
        "- Empty strings or whitespace: Try \"username\": \"\", \"email\": \" \" and verify rejection.\n",
        "- Long input strings: Submit usernames and emails >256 characters to test size limits and app stability.\n",
        "- Case-insensitivity test: Register User and then try user; test whether overwriting occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Welcome Page (GET /welcome/) - Harden Authorization and Output Handling\n",
        "- XSS verification: Confirm that usernames or emails containing HTML/JavaScript are not rendered as executable content. (Expected behavior: escape special characters.)\n",
        "- Unicode/emoji support: Try usernames like \"测试\" or \"user🙂\" and ensure the system handles them correctly.\n",
        "- Directory traversal attempt: Use ../admin as a username and confirm no path resolution issues occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Security Tests - Threat Simulation\n",
        "- Stored XSS confirmation: After injecting the script tag, access the welcome page and validate that the script is not executed.\n",
        "- Cross-user message spoofing: Try registering alice with bob@example.com and visiting /welcome/alice — does it allow impersonation?\n",
        "- HTTP method tampering: Try using PUT/DELETE or GET on /register and ensure only POST is allowed.\n",
        "- Header injection: Attempt CRLF injection in username/email (e.g., \"user\\r\\nSet-Cookie: admin=true\") to check if headers are manipulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Error Handling & Logging\n",
        "- Test safe error messages: Induce an internal error (e.g., omit required field) and confirm the response does not expose stack traces or internal code.\n",
        "- Debug mode off in production: Ensure debug=True is flagged as a finding in the design review and tested (in production, this should be False)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Secure Communications\n",
        "- Access over HTTP vs HTTPS: Attempt to use the app over HTTP and verify whether secure cookies or HTTPS headers are enforced if applicable (test in a deployment context).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Environment & Dependency Management\n",
        "- Outdated package test: Confirm whether the Flask version is current.\n",
